# MinimaxTacToe
### An undefeatable browser based AI that plays Tic Tac Toe 
I got acquainted to the minimax algorithm when I did the MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence course. 
It is a backtracking algorithm used for decision making in games, it uses a heuristic approach to MINImize the score of the human player and MAXimize the AI's score, hence the name 'minimax'

It is  widely used in two-player games to minimize the worst case(maximum) potential loss.
